- Purpose: Random utilities for development work
- Comments:
  - import imports a new article lead-only article from a file "lead.txt".
    - Use as follows:
    - 1) Edit a file "lead.txt" to include the desired text.
    -    Optionally, edit a file "body.txt" to include the desired text.
    - 2) Invoke inside Forth: S" My Desired Title" import
    -    Optionally, afterwards, invoke: w/body
    - 3) For the paranoid: flush
  - w/body assumes you've already run import; it stores the contents of body.txt in the GOS, and assigns the handle to the body field.
