- Purpose:
  - Provide HTML content for a web request.
  - Expand macros in an HTML template.

- Assumptions:
  - VARIABLE s points to beginning of response template.
  - VARIABLE end points past last byte of response template.
  - Any template expansion handlers referenced by the response
    template must already be defined.

- Effects:
  - VARIABLE s = end
  - HERE points past last byte of response expansion.
  - Response expansion sent to stdout for web server.

- Comments:
  - -eos = true iff at end of response template.
  - -eon = true iff at end of current macro name token.
  - name yields a (caddr,u) string containing the name of the macro,
    where u >= 0.  If u=0, unexpected end of token was discovered.
  - macro consumes the sentinel ~ then executes the macro's handler.
  - Macros which aren't defined are consumed silently; they are considered No-ops.

- Intended use:
    ( perform speculative data acquisition here )
    ( define macro handlers here )
    ( read appropriate template file into core here )
    VARIABLE s    template-start-addr s !
    VARIABLE end  template-end-addr end !
    include response.fs
    bye
