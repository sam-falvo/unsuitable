- Purpose:
  - Maintains the articles table.
  - Each column takes /afields bytes in block space.
  - Columns:
    - articleId (integer).  Uniquely identifies the article amongst all others.
      - (articleId = -1) => row is free for re-use and all other fields undefined.
      - Otherwise, 0 < articleId.
  - Accessors:
    - article/article! gets/sets current article record.
    - articleId/articleId! gets/sets ID

- Comments:
  - Persistent VARIABLE a-nextId (block 1) = the ID to assign the next article.
  - VARIABLE arn = current article record number.
  - available = next available record number.
  - Note that record numbers (offsets into column arrays) /= article IDs.
    - record numbers used by software to identify an article.
    - article IDs used by humans to identify an article via the URL.
    - Distinction required to allow deletions of articles, where the next
      article contribution will re-use the vacated table row.
