- Purpose:
  - Scans the article table for the latest five postings
- Assumes
  - articles.fs loaded
- Comments:
  - e0 = address of first of five record references
  - e4 = address of last record reference
  - ep = pointer to head of current (sub)vector.
  - e0..e4 obeys invariant, given T(x) = (x article! timestamp):
    - (e0 <= ep < e5)
    - forall(i, (e0 <= i <= ep) implies (i@ <> nil))
    - forall(i, (e1 <= i <= ep) implies (T(i@) <= T((i-1)@)))
    - forall(i, (ep+1 <= i < e5) implies (i@ = nil))
