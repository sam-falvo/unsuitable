(originally from Bitbucket)

Once upon a time, someone on Reddit responded to a screencast video I produced claiming the Forth programming language was "completely unsuitable" for contemporary software development. Naturally, I took this as a challenge. Unsuitable is the world's first blog engine written entirely in Forth (Gforth to be specific). I wrote Unsuitable to address specific problems I was facing with other blogs at the time. Many will find Unsuitable to be grossly under-featured compared to others currently available. I don't care -- Unsuitable fulfills all of my blogging needs. No documentation exists, except for what used to exist on my blog, formerly found at http://www.falvotech.com/blog2/blog.fs . NOTE: The blog was designed for use on a 32-bit environment. As I now run a 64-bit Linux environment, the blog is broken, and will not behave as expected. Since I've since become a Google+ user, I'm not really motivated to fix it. Patches welcome. Unsuitable is, at present, a solo coding effort: I'm writing it by myself *for* myself. I publish the source code for the benefit of those who have expressed curiosity towards how Unsuitable works, or how Forth can be applied in a web-application environment. If you express interest in contributing enhancements to Unsuitable, particularly fixing it for use on a 64-bit environment, please e-mail me first.
